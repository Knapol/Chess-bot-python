Bot uses alpha-beta pruning, move ordering and transposition tables with zobrist hashing. Position evaluation is very simple, as it only counts material and adds points based on figures position.

Code itself is messy, since at that time I didn't really had much knowledge about oop principles. However it's my first bigger project.
